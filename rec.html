        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Design Opportunity</h2>

        <p class="cs-body">
          My inspiration for this project started when I wanted to book a yoga class through UC San
          Diego Recreation. Instead of a simple process, I found myself clicking in circles through a
          cluttered website that made even basic tasks feel confusing. That frustration made me
          wonder if this was just a UCSD issue or a larger problem across recreation platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          I began looking at other UC campuses–most of their websites were serviceable, though not
          always elegant. But I found a deeper issue with their mobile apps, where almost all buttons
          redirected me to the website, and the app did not serve a clear purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          To dig further, I spoke with UCSD students and faculty about their own experiences. The
          pattern was clear—while they valued Recreation as part of campus life, almost everyone
          avoided the app after a few attempts. Many described it as “unfinished,” while others
          simply deleted it. Even the website–which was functional–felt overwhelming and difficult
          on mobile.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          I saw UC San Diego’s underperforming digital tools as an inconvenience to the
          organization’s ability to deliver on its mission: to engage the campus community in
          lifelong well-being and active living. If students can’t easily book a class, check
          schedules, or reserve a court, then the digital platform is failing to support the very
          values of inclusion, service, and community that UC Rec stands for. It became an
          opportunity for me to address this issue and connect my campus community to UC Rec’s
          thriving in-person programs.

        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Refining The Flow</h2>

        <p class="cs-body">
          To move from research to design, I created an empathy map and user journeys to understand
          how different users, including students and faculty, interact with UC Recreation. From
          there, I developed personas and drafted multiple user flows to compare pain points in
          booking classes versus booking courts. I sketched low-fidelity wireframes of each option to
          visualize potential improvements.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          A key trade-off was deciding which flow to prioritize. While faculty had valid needs, the
          interviews showed that undergraduates were the most frustrated with booking courts through
          the app. Since they also represented the majority of users, I chose to focus on this flow
          for the redesign. This decision allowed me to directly address the highest pain point with
          the clearest opportunity for improvement.
        </p>

        <p class="cs-body">
          The redesigned flow begins with a secure single sign-on using UCSD credentials. From the
          homepage, students can quickly select the type of court they want, view available time
          slots, and finalize a booking in just a few taps. They also have the flexibility to add
          their reservation to a calendar, modify details, or cancel if needed.

        <p class="cs-body">
          After building the high-fidelity prototype, I tested the flow with undergraduate students
          who regularly use UC Recreation. Their feedback gave me two key opportunities: adding
          reminder notifications before reservations and providing confirmation after check-in. I
          designed a notification system and added a QR-based check-in feature to close the loop,
          making the experience reliable and complete.

        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Reflections &amp; Learnings</h2>

        <p class="cs-body">
          If I had more time, I would expand this project to include the user flow for booking
          fitness classes, making the app more accessible for a wider range of UC Recreation users.
          For this case study, I intentionally narrowed the scope to court booking, so I could
          deliver a high-fidelity prototype with a clear, reliable flow that minimized confusion and
          helped students reach their goal.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          This project taught me how to prioritize impact, make trade-offs, and design with focus. I
          also strengthened my skills in Figma, especially in visual design and high-fidelity
          prototyping, while gaining confidence in applying user feedback to iterate on interaction
          design decisions.
