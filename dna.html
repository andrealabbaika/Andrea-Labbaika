              DNA: Website Design for an IT Platform
            </h1>
            <p class="cs-intro">
              Robot ICT is an IT automation company based in Prague, and DNA (Dynamic Network Automation)
              is its flagship product. DNA is a powerful platform that simplifies complex IT tasks for
              mid to large-sized companies, yet the company’s online presence didn’t reflect its strengths.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-intro">
              The original microsite was just a single page with minimal content, leaving the product
              underrepresented compared to global competitors. This project was about giving DNA a polished
              website that matched the quality of the product itself.

        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Why the Microsite Fell Short</h2>

        <p class="cs-body">
          The challenge wasn’t with the product, but rather how it was being presented. The microsite
          lacked structure, clear CTAs, and a visual design that communicated credibility. Users
          couldn’t see DNA’s robustness or understand how it stood apart from competitors like Cisco
          or Juniper, which had highly polished and persuasive websites.

        </div>

        <p class="cs-body">
          To address this, I conducted competitor analysis in the automation industry, a SWOT analysis
          for Robot ICT, and communicated with the team to follow their business priorities. DNA’s
          mission is to help organizations automate IT processes efficiently and securely, but the
          website wasn’t aligned with that mission. My goal was to narrow this gap by redesigning the
          site to highlight DNA’s features, reflect the company’s values, and guide users toward
          understanding the product.

        <h2 class="cs-section-title">New Design &amp; Strategy</h2>

        <p class="cs-body">
          I restructured the site to focus on clarity and business goals. Low-fidelity prototypes were
          created in Figma, then implemented in Framer to refine the designs and publish the final
          website. The top navigation emphasized Free Trial and Self-Guided Demo, which were the two
          most important CTAs.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          The landing page was redesigned to showcase DNA’s key features upfront, followed by tabs
          highlighting solutions for specific industries, integrations with tools, and detailed use
          cases. Instead of building an overwhelming number of pages, I narrowed the structure to a
          handful of essential ones: Product, Resources, and About Us. This made the site easy to
          navigate while still communicating necessary information.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          Each page was designed to balance high-quality visuals with practical information, so that
          the new website not only looked professional but also supported DNA’s positioning against
          established competitors.

        <p class="cs-body">
          By the end of the project, I had designed fully responsive screens for desktop, tablet, and
          mobile, making sure that every page felt consistent and polished. The new website transforms
          DNA’s presence from an underpowered microsite into a professional, structured platform with
          clear navigation and calls-to-action.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          The redesign better communicates DNA’s strengths, creates a more compelling first impression
          for prospective clients, and helps position Robot ICT alongside global competitors in the IT
          automation space.

        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h2>

        <p class="cs-body">
          This project pushed me to strengthen my technical design skills, especially working in Figma
          and Framer, while also improving my competitor research abilities. At the same time, I
          recognized a limitation: without clearly defined user groups, I couldn’t conduct interviews
          or usability testing.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          If I had more time and clarity on the audience—such as IT administrators in cloud services
          or telecom—I would have involved them in walkthroughs of the original microsite to note pain
          points, then iterated with usability studies on the redesigned flows.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          This experience focused more on strengthening my visual and structural design skills, while
          reminding me how important it is to ground future projects in deeper user research so the
          final product truly reflects the needs of its primary users.
